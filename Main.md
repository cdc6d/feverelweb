# Introduction #

FeverelWeb is a Web application that allows textual scholars to read and compare different editions and versions of George Meredith's 19th century novel, _The Ordeal of Richard Feverel_.  You can access the latest version here:

http://feverelweb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/index.html


# Status #

You can currently use FeverelWeb to read and compare one chapter from three different versions of the novel.


# Development Road Map #

We are pursuing two parallel goals:
  * Improve the user interface for reading and comparing texts.
  * Add annotated text for all chapters of all important _Feverel_ editions and versions.

In the long term, we'd like to go beyond _Feverel_ and develop a front end for displaying many texts that are electronically encoded in formats such as [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/).
