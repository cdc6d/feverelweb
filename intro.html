In 1905, he was awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. But by 1927, his reputation had begun to diminish, as E. M. Forster takes pains to express: “Meredith is not the great name he was twenty or thirty years ago, when much of the universe and all Cambridge trembled [...] Meredith is himself now in the trough of a wave, and though fashion will turn and raise him a bit, he will never be the spiritual power he was about the year 1900.”</span><a href="#Footnote1" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">1</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> Virginia Woolf confirms this assessment five years later, but also illustrates, in lovely prose, the halo that once surrounded Meredith at the height of his powers:</span></div>

Then, too, it was generally discovered that the maker of these splendid books was himself a splendid old man. Visitors who went down to Box Hill reported that they were thrilled as they walked up the drive of the little suburban house by the sound of a voice booming and reverberating within [...] It did not much matter, perhaps, whether his audience was cultivated or simple [...] To neither could he speak the simple language of daily life. But all the time this highly wrought, artificial conversation, with its crystallised phrases and its high-piled metaphors, moved and tossed on a current of laughter. His laugh curled round his sentences as if he himself enjoyed their humorous exaggeration. The master of language was splashing and diving in his element of words. So the legend grew [...]</span><a href="#Footnote2" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">2</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">   </span></div>

As Forster writes: “The tailors are not tailors, the cricket matches are not cricket, the railway trains do not even seem to be trains [...] It is surely very odd, the social scene in which his characters are set: it is partly due to his fantasy, which is legitimate, but partly a chilly fake, and wrong.”</span><a href="#Footnote3" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">3</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> Forster’s criticism assumes that Meredith’s tailors </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">should</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> be tailors -- that Meredith fails in an attempt to mimetically represent, as Woolf later writes, the “language of daily life.” This was a language that Meredith did not speak, nor one that he sought to imitate. We find a perfect example of this in </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">. With brilliant perception, Woolf writes of the work: “He has been, it is plain, at great pains to destroy the conventional forms of the novel. He makes no attempt to preserve the sober reality of Trollope and Jane Austen; he has destroyed all the usual staircases by which we have learnt to climb.”</span><a href="#Footnote4" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">4</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> </span></div>

Richard C. Stevenson, for instance, finds Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of the dialogic imagination useful in understanding the book’s vacillating prose, whose “countervailing narrative voices” propel the narrative “away from any kind of generic unity to a dizzying mixture of satire, comedy, romance, and, finally, tragedy.”</span><a href="#Footnote5" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">5</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> Along the same lines, one might read the novel as a pastiche, which at every turn forces readers to confront the ways in which they interpret the modes and patterns native to writing and reading. In this way, the novel’s formal construction fully embraces and integrates its themes of misreading</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; "> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">and failed human relationships; readers, struggling amidst its various strains of laughter, cynicism, sentiment, and sorrow along with its numerous interpolated letters, diaries, songs, and fragments from other texts (not to mention its myriad references to other literary works) must, in many ways, relinquish any easy understanding of the narrator’s purpose in telling the story. While works depicted in the novel like Sir Austin’s Pilgrim’s Scrip and “note-book” and Dr Kitchener’s “Domestic Cookery” book</span><a href="#Footnote6" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">6</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> offer concrete instructions and announce themselves as systematic guides, the novel itself purposefully denies its readers any such key for understanding </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">its </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">content.</span></div>

On this subject, Michael Collie’s </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">George Meredith: A Bibliography</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> (1974) provides the most accurate and thorough study of Meredith to date. According to Collie, Meredith wrote </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> between August 1857 and June 1859 while living in Hobury Street in London, and the novel was published in the typical three-decker format by Chapman and Hall on June 20, 1859.</span><a href="#Footnote7" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">7</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> This publication date is corroborated in C.

My copy of the 1859 first edition of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> (used extensively for this project and described in more detail on the “Editions” page) contains, at the back of volume three, 36 pages of ads dated April 1859  -- an unusually early date, apparently, for Collie and other sources regularly mention ads dated July 1859, if ads are present at all.</span><a href="#Footnote9" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">9</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> The book was marketed, as usual, to circulating libraries; however, Mudie’s Lending Library, which subscribed for 300 copies, withdrew </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">from circulation by October of 1859; according to Meredith, Mudie was compelled to do this in response to the “urgent remonstrances of several respectable families, who objected to it as dangerous and wicked and damnable.”</span><a href="#Footnote10" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">10</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">  The reaction is not entirely surprising when one considers that the novel’s self-proclaimed “hero” and “heroine” marry half way through the book, only for readers to witness the excruciatingly slow dismantling of what seemed an ideal relationship. Perhaps one of the funniest accounts one finds of a reader’s reaction is that of the Reverend Augustus Jessop, which Meredith summarizes in a letter written in November of 1861: “One man, head-master of a grammar school, writes a six-page letter of remonstrance and eulogy [...] He says that the “Enchantress” scene in </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">R</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">[</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">ichard</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">] </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> made him ill for 24 hours; and that he and his friends (Cambridge men) rank me next to Tennyson in poetic power.”</span><a href="#Footnote11" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">11</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "></span></div>

Even during the early stages of writing, Meredith was fully aware that he was tinkering with the traditional form of the novel. In January 1858, he reports on the writing of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">:</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; "> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">“It goes on so so. Everything I do is an Experiment, and till it’s done, I never know whether ’tis worth a farthing.”</span><a href="#Footnote12" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">12</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> Apparently, Meredith waited a long time: he would revise the text over the next three decades, settling on a final “authorized” version only in 1896. Largely owing the novel’s initial commercial failure in 1859, it was not republished again until 1875 in Leipzig by Bernhard Tauchnitz as numbers 1508 and 1509 of the “Collection of British Authors.” Meredith, who in 1873 was already complaining of the novel’s “offensive” “lumpy style,”</span><a href="#Footnote13" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">13</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> immediately seized the opportunity to revise the work. This resulted in the first infamous “cut” of the novel, in which the first four chapters -- “The Pilgrim’s Scrip,” “A Glimpse Behind the Mask,” “Mrs. Malediction,” and “The Inmates of Raynham Abbey” -- were condensed into one chapter. It is important to note, with Collie, that Meredith did not remove the famous “Enchantress” scene that sickened and distressed so many readers. Rather, the changes were connected to structure and style.</span><a href="#Footnote14" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">14</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> L. T. Hergenhan characterizes the revisions as largely relating to Sir Austin’s “System,” to “caricatured figures,” to “burlesque and satiric scenes,” and to “exaggerated and fanciful descriptions of behaviour.”</span><a href="#Footnote15" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">15</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> My collation of the 1859 and 1875 versions of the chapter, “Indicates the Approaches of Fever,” corroborate this view, though in much more detail. Minor edits include regular changes to spelling and contractions (</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">e.g</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">. “were n’t” to “weren’t”; “is n’t” to “isn’t”) along with small changes to punctuation. More significant and most frequent are changes in capitalization: “Baronet” changes to “baronet,” “Parish” to “parish,” “Perdition” to “perdition,” and so on. When “Fact” becomes “fact” and “Love” turns to “love,” the narrator’s mode markedly changes from mock- or didactic- or earnest-philosophical (depending on the context) to a more understated, ambiguous one; the changes soften the eccentric and exaggerated play in narrative’s stylistic presentation, and perhaps they were made to draw readers closer to the novel’s story. Along similar lines, we find that wily Tom Bakewell’s exaggerated dialect is more regularized: for example, “Peninsoolar” changes to “Peninsular” and “speert” to “spirit,” reducing the degree to which he is caricatured. One large substantive edit occurs in Carola’s speech: an account of her mother’s smoking habit is deleted. Again, the effect is to minimize the more outrageous, burlesque aspects of the narrative.</span></div>

Keegan Paul in 1878, which appeared in one volume bound in olive green cloth. (The contract between Meredith and Keegan Paul also still exists and is held by the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library; a typewritten agreement dated November 3, 1877, it gives Keegan Paul copyright to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> for seven years at the price of 6s., with Meredith to receive 1s. 6d, per copy after 750 copies sold.)</span><a href="#Footnote16" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">16</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> Here Collie writes that the Keegan Paul edition “is identical, except in insignificant detail, to Tauchnitz, but it is printed from new plates.”</span><a href="#Footnote17" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">17</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> This description is deceptive; one would think, from reading it, that the these texts were almost identical. But when one turns to study a chapter in close detail, one is immediately struck by the different line breaks and extensively altered punctuation: here colons become semi-colons, there colons become em dashes; now em dashes disappear entirely, now they are retained. A contraction becomes uncontracted (e.g. “you’re” to “you are”), a question mark becomes an exclamation mark, and on and on. In short, the punctuation changes, but is not consistently regularized in any fashion. I have tracked these details in my edition of “Indicates the Approaches of Fever” as they might prove more significant to some than others.</span></div>

The contract for this agreement, dated June, 2 1885, can be found in the Altschul Collection at Yale, in which Chapman and Hall obtained the right to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> (and four other works) for seven years for £500--an agreement which Chapman and Hall would break, by continuing to sell and print copies of the “New Edition” after the seven years elapsed.</span><a href="#Footnote18" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">18</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> (In 1893, Meredith negotiated a new agreement with the firm that allowed Chapman and Hall to continue to publish the “New Editon” for three more years; in addition, the new contract stipulated that he would receive a 25 percent royalty on all of the copies that were sold after the initial seven-year contract for the “New Edition” had expired.</span><a href="#Footnote19" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">19</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">)  Collie reports that one can find a copies of the second edition corrected in Meredith’s handwriting in the Altschul Collection at Yale and in the Houghton Library at Harvard, but that neither appear to have been used as the basis for the revised 1885 edition.</span><a href="#Footnote20" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">20</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> According to Collie, the “New Edition” was printed by three separate firms: Virtue in 1885 (sold at 6s); Clowes in 1890 (sold at 3s.6d. and bound in blue cloth, instead of the 1885 green); and George Bell in 1895 (often referred to as the “Colonial” issue [price not given by Collie]).</span><a href="#Footnote21" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">21</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">  I have collated all three printings in my study of “Indicates the Approaches of Fever.”</span></div>

Collie uncharacteristically makes a blunder when he writes that the deletion of chapter XIX, “A Shadowy View of Cœlebs Pater Going About with a Glass-Slipper” (the chapter devoted to the Grandisons), “did not occur until 1885.”</span><a href="#Footnote22" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">22</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> In fact, this deletion first occurs in 1896, and it directly affects our study of the “Indicates the Approaches of Fever,” as Carola Grandison, by necessity, is entirely removed from it when the prior chapter is deleted. Instead, my work shows that most of the changes were confined to regularizing punctuation -- specifically, with the deletion of many of the em dashes in favor of no punctuation and with the splitting of longer sentences into clauses and phrases by the insertion of additional commas.  Some substantive changes also occur: for example, with respect to Adrian’s description of Lucy’s Catholic worship, “being made clean” becomes “been made clean” (this cannot be considered a correction, as both versions are grammatically correct). Similarly “meditate the day” becomes “meditate on the day”; again, both are grammatically correct, as “meditate” can take the form of a transitive verb. But the transitive use of “meditate” is more characteristic of Meredith; the novel’s fabulous last line contains a striking example: ‘ “This is just how Richard looks, as he lies silent in his bed--striving to</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; "> image</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> her on his brain.” ’ I would be curious to investigate this particular alteration further to learn how and why the change occurred. New errors also occur in the “New Edition,” including the misspelling of “agricultural” as “agriculural” and the clumsy handling of  “wh ich” -- not surprising to one familiar with Meredith’s correspondence, in which he complains to Frederic Chapman in November of 1888: </span></div>

<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 13pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding-bottom: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt;">Many of these errors persisted in the 1890 and 1895 Chapman and Hall copies of the “New Edition”; in fact, both of those already mentioned (“agriculural” and “wh ich”) still occur despite other deliberate corrections to the text. One such correction to the 1895 text includes “stedfast,” which in the 1885 and 1890 “New Edition” appeared as “steadfast.” (It is my view that this was a deliberate change, for the word appears as “stedfast” in the 1859 first edition, and it stands in the 1896 Archibald Constable edition, which Meredith carefully revised.) Also, “it,” which appears on page 172 in the 1885 and 1890 “New Edition” as “t” (with the “i” missing by accident) is corrected in the 1895 “New Edition.” Because I have only collated and studied one chapter in detail, it is still unclear whether the 1890 “New Edition” is, in fact, a reprinting of the 1885 edition, or whether, like the 1895 “New Edition,” it is, in fact, a separate edition in its own right.</div>
<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 13pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding-bottom: 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">    A full collation of the 1885, 1890, and 1895 Chapman and Hall “New Edition” could potentially shed light on additional deletions made to the novel, which are mentioned in a letter written by Meredith to the American publisher Roberts Brothers in February of 1895, where Meredith warns the publisher of a cut scene that formerly took place between Mrs Berry and Ripton Thompson after the Richard’s wedding.</span><a href="#Footnote24" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">24</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> While this firm plays a somewhat minor role in the history, it is worth mentioning. According to Collie, Roberts Brothers initially distributed the Chapman and Hall “New Edition” in 1886 -- buying unbound copies from the English publisher and replacing the titlepage with their own, marketing the book as “Author’s Edition.” The firm bought impressions of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> from Chapman and Hall through 1893, when the Roberts Brothers’ stock reports show that the American firm started printing their own copies of the book, which was issued in two separate bindings.</span><a href="#Footnote25" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">25</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> Collie writes that “neither Meredith nor Chapman and Hall seem to have known about the reprinting until after it occurred. The edition has no textual importance. The plates were later sold to Scribners but not used.”</span><a href="#Footnote26" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">26</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> Whether these books are of significance is debatable. A collation of the Roberts Brothers text might, in fact, turn up something of interest down the road. As of yet, I have not collated my copies against the Chapman and Hall, C. Keegan Paul, and Archibald Constable publications currently available as electronic documentary editions in this archive, as the latter are undoubtedly of more importance due to Meredith’s known involvement in their revision (a history which, in itself, also still demands further study).    </span></div>
<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 13pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding-bottom: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt;">    Finally, parts of the book were most famously and drastically cut in 1896 for the Archibald Constable “De Luxe” edition, quarter bound in white cloth, with pink cloth covering the upper and lower boards. The most substantial change involved the deletion of an additional chapter (already mentioned earlier in this essay): “A Shadowy View of Cœlebs Pater Going About with a Glass-Slipper” (the chapter devoted to the Grandisons). A direct result of this change was the large deletion in “Indicates the Approaches of Fever” of Carola Grandison and Richard’s conversation. But, as we can see in looking at the revisions and deletions made elsewhere at the chapter, Meredith’s hand was all over the text -- cutting here, rewriting and rewording there, making changes to substantives and accidentals alike. Single quotations are consistently exchanged for double quotations and vice versa, with a few exceptions related to quotations in the 1859 first edition. New changes tend to streamline the text, continuing the earlier work of reducing the more burlesque passages and of speeding up the action in the narrative. Richard’s conversation with Tom Bakewell is much tightened and shorted, for example. For all of these new corrections, it’s important to note that almost all substantive revisions that took place after 1859 are retained. (The only exception: on page 207 “further” is restored, as it originally appeared in the 1859 first edition, from the [presumably accidental] change made to “farther,” which appears in all of the intermediate editions.) Previous revisions to accidentals also tend to stand, although there are more exceptions. The many mistakes of the Chapman and Hall “New Edition” have been corrected. For example, on page 214 “away” comes back, having appeared as “way” from 1885-95, and “Winter,” which had appeared as uncapitalized “winter” since 1875, is restored to its capitalized form as it originally appeared in 1859.  Also, the quotation from The Pilgrim’s Scrip, which appeared in italics from 1875 onwards, appears in the unitalicized Roman type of 1859. An interleaved copy of the 1895 Chapman and Hall “New Edition” is held by Yale in the Altschul collection; I hope to view and obtain photographs for this material, which will be necessary in order to create a proper critical edition of the 1896 text.</div>
<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 13pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding-bottom: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt;">    The 1896 edition was reissued again in 1897. This edition, marketed as the “revised edition,” was bound in a distinctive deep red cloth. Whether this edition contains additional corrections by Meredith is unknown to me, and I have yet to collate it against the 1896 edition. I currently own two copies in my collection, and I intend to address this aspect of the publication history in the near future.</div>

Currently, no scholarly critical edition exists for </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">The 1909-1911 Memorial Edition of 27 volumes, published by Archibald Constable, is the closest any edition has come to addressing the novel’s drastic transformation.

In 1974, Collie notes: “it is worth mentioning that there have been only two or three serious twentieth-century attempts to edit single novels by Meredith properly. Such work remains to be done and one can only regret, as ever, the re-issuing of unedited books -- a practice which hampers study of several nineteenth-century novelists.”</span><a href="#Footnote28" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">28</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> In 1993, Barbara Rosenbaum writes that there are only three modern critical editions of Meredith’s novels: </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">The Adventures of Harry </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">Richmond, edited by L.

Hergenhan (1970); </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">One of Our Conquerors</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">, edited by Margaret Harris (1975); and previously unpublished portions of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">The Adventures of Harry Richmond</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">, edited by Sven-Johan Spanberg (1990). But, Rosenbaum adds, “while these editions discuss the available manuscripts sources, they do not provide newly-edited texts.”</span><a href="#Footnote29" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">29</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">  Clearly, not everyone agrees on what constitutes a critical edition.

The Adams edition reprints “the authorized edition of 1897,” published by Archibald Constable, without any editorial emendations. (The publisher is not mentioned anywhere in the textual notes.) The Adams edition offers an extremely slim two-page historical collation of the 1897 text with the 1879 first edition, which was published by Chapman and Hall (who also goes unmentioned). The collation contains only substantive variants and offers no explanation for their history.</span><a href="#Footnote30" style="font-size: 7.9pt; line-height: 14pt; vertical-align: 0.50em; ">30</a><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> Still, in 2008 the Adams edition of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">The Egoist</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> is probably the most widely read edition of any of Meredith’s novels.  </span></div>

Indeed, the idea for this edition began in response to a practical need. During the spring of 2008, I attended a graduate-level course taught by Jerome McGann at the University of Virginia. One of the works the class was assigned to read was </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> However, there were some problems in obtaining a text. First, the book was in print only through generic eLibron, BiblioBazaar, and Kessinger reprints of previous editions. (We settled on reading the Modern Library edition, introduced by Lionel Stevenson, and based on the 1859 first edition. Out of curiosity and for practical purposes, I collated this against the other copies of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> in order to get a feel for how reliable it was; and, as far as I can tell, while there are some errors, it is not too bad.) Second, no edition of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; "> has taken into account the history of its extensive revisions. One must choose among three different works: Chapman and Hall 1859; Tauchnitz/Keegan Paul 1875/1878, and Archibald Constable 1896. Finally, many of the articles and sources written about the novel’s textual history contain errors, which mislead students and scholars trying to understand the differences between the revised editions. Lionel Stevenson’s introduction, for example, makes a similar mistake to Collie’s; he attributes the excision of the Grandison chapter to the 1878 Keegan Paul edition. And nowhere, amid his discussion of the publishing history, does he discuss Archibald Constable’s 1896 edition, with its drastic revisions.</span></div>
