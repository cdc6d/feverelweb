<h3>A Work in Progress</h3>

<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 13pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding-bottom: 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">Welcome to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; text-decoration: underline; ">The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; text-decoration: underline; ">: A Web Archive of Documentary and Critical Editions</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">. This project was started at the University of Virginia in response to two stimulating and inspiring courses taught in the spring of 2008: Jerome McGann’s “</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-variant: small-caps; line-height: 14pt; text-transform: none; ">c</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">19 Discourse Formations” and David Vander Meulen’s “Introduction to Scholarly Editing.” Even as we searched for an appropriate version of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt; ">to read in McGann’s class (a process described in more detail at the end of the first part of my introduction), I looked for a work to edit as my final project for Vander Meulen’s course. It did not take me long to put two and two together. In addition, I had the good fortune to be engaged to Carsten Clark, a computer programmer with extra time on his hands and seemingly infinite patience; he is the author of the dynamic html presentation system that comprises the website. Finally, being a book collector by nature and a rare book curator by profession, I was unafraid of starting a new collection. And so it all began.    </span></div>
<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 13pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding-bottom: 12pt; padding-top: 0pt; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0; line-height: 14pt; opacity: 1.00; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none;">    The result is the present archive, which contains working documentary editions of the chapter “Indicates the Approaches of Fever” as published in the original 1859 Chapman and Hall, 1875 Tauchnitz, and 1896 Archibald Constable editions. These new, searchable electronic documents preserve original pagination, original line breaks, and offer notes in dynamic html (a combination of JavaScript, CSS, and html) that provide full information on my historical collation of eight different texts of textual and/or scholarly significance:</div>

<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 13pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding-bottom: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 14pt;">I have created flat-file documentary editions of “Indicates the Approaches of Fever” for all of these books, and it is only a matter of time (and some coding) before all of them are available on the web with live notes. At present, I have created over 11,000 lines of html for this project, and I have spent more than 60 hours coding the three available texts. I estimate that it will take about 70-80 hours to code the remaining electronic documents.</div>
<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 13pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding-bottom: 12pt; padding-top: 0pt; text-align: left; text-indent: 0pt; "><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0; line-height: 14pt; opacity: 1.00; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; ">    And what of the critically edited texts promised in the title of the website?

<h3>Procedures</h3>

<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 14pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; padding-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 14pt;">This project presented many obstacles. No reliable historical electronic text exists for any of these documents. Also, the majority of the editions appear in entirely different formats, with different line breaks. For this reason, it was not feasible to conduct my work with a Lindstrand or Hinman collator, which significantly slowed down the process of transcription and collation.    </div>
<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 14pt; "><span>    To start my project, I began with a copy of </span><span style="font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">Richard Feverel </span><span>downloaded from Project Gutenberg. (This text was most likely based on one of the later Archibald Constable</span><span style="font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; "> </span><span>editions, but its origins remain unclear.) I edited this text as a Macintosh Pages document to conform to the 1950 Modern Library edition. Having revised the file and saved it under its new name (ML1950), I saved a second copy under the new name, CH1859, and then began collating it against UVa’s copy of the 1859 Chapman and Hall first edition. As I moved through the file, I updated line breaks, pagination, and made notes in brackets whenever I discovered a variant. (See sample document.) Before accepting any variant, though, I again compared my notes and my transcriptions to the original printed books. In this way, although editing the 1859 edition, I invariably caught many small errors made in my editing and transcription of the 1950 Modern Library edition. I then moved on to the Tauchnitz edition, following the same procedure, but saving a second copy of the CH1859 document under the new name T1875. Again, whenever I came across variants, I made notes in brackets and referred to the original copies. In this way, I was able to produce very refined versions of all of the editions used in this project.         </span></div>
<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 14pt; "><span>    Except for the 1878 C. Keegan Paul edition, all of the documentary texts that appear in this project were drawn from the personal collection I created while working on this project. Finding a copy of the 1859 Chapman and Hall first edition available for sale and realizing how useful it would be to have a copy immediately on hand, I purchased it for my (growing) collection. Collating this copy against my transcription of the UVa copy was a very useful exercise; it turned up a few additional variants that I had missed. As I have time, I intend to collate my current documentary editions against other multiple copies in order to catch any further changes that might have been missed. A further method to check and improve the texts would be to translate images of the original documents via OCR and then to collate those texts against my existing ones via Juxta. I will probably carry this out only after I have photographed all of the pages from the editions currently documented in this project (</span><span style="font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">i.e.</span><span> in this list above; also see “Design Goals” below).</span><span style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 14pt; "></span></div>

<h3>Design and Editorial Goals</h3>

<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 14pt; ">Carsten Clark and I hope to create a website that is easy to navigate and practical for study. Users should not have to read a “how-to” manual or lengthy introduction to learn how to use the site; design and organization should be as intuitive and flexible as possible, allowing users the option of reading and working with texts in as many ways possible. For example, historical collations will be provided in a table that can be sorted, as well as in the form of “floating” and “sticky” notes that users can manipulate or dismiss depending on their reading preferences (see no. 2 for more details).</div>
<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 14pt; "><span style="font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; ">1) To provide documentary editions of all editions of </span><span>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</span><span style="font-style: italic; line-height: 14pt; "> that were published during Meredith’s lifetime, as well as documentary editions of influential later printings (such as the Modern Library edition, based on the 1859 Chapman and Hall first edition) </span></div>
<div class="paragraph Body" style="line-height: 14pt; ">--Preserve original pagination of copies (currently available for CH1859, T1875, and AC1896)</div>
